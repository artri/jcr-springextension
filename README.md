# JCR Spring-Extension
## What is JCR Spring-Extension?

* It is an clone/fork from here 
* It is not listed as an official [Spring-Extension](http://www.springsource.org/extensions). 

## How to build

This project uses Maven to build all artifacts.

Check out the source with:

`git clone https://github.com/jbellmann/jcr-springextension.git`

then `mvn install` will do the build.

## Examples

Not yet.

## Why do I put this code here?

I issued that that on [Spring-Issue-Tracker](https://jira.springsource.org/browse/SEJCR-21). But I got no answer from the team. So to work on it I put the code here and if someone at SpringSource feels responsible for this project we can move it to an official github-repo at SpringSource.
