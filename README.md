[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jbellmann/jsc-springextension.png)](https://travis-ci.org/jbellmann/jcr-springextension)


## What is JCR Spring-Extension?

* It is an clone/fork from [here] (https://src.springframework.org/svn/se-jcr/)
* It is not listed as an official [Spring-Extension](http://www.springsource.org/extensions)

## How to build

This project uses Gradle to build all artifacts.

Check out the source with:

`git clone https://github.com/jbellmann/jcr-springextension.git`

if you have Gradle installed you can build the project with `gradle build`

if you have not installed Gradle yet, run the wrapper with `./gradlew build` on linux or `gradlew.bat build` on windows.

## Branches

`master` as trunk in svn when forked, just a README.md added.

`1.0.x` as trunk in svn when forked, maybe someone will need it to create fixes or other stuff

`develop` updated stuff since forking the svn-trunk, uses latest versions of spring,jackrabbit,slf4j,JTA, removed most deprecated code for using JCR-2.0

## Issue-Tracking

Please use the [Issue-Tracker at SpringSource](https://jira.springsource.org/browse/SEJCR) for this project.

## Examples

Not yet.

## Why do I put this code here?

I issued that at the [Issue-Tracker](https://jira.springsource.org/browse/SEJCR-21). But got no answer from the team.
So to work on it I put the code here and if someone at SpringSource feels responsible for this project we can move it to an official github-repo at SpringSource.
